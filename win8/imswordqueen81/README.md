Pros:
- Comes with all the important SKUs: Core, Pro, ProWMC, Enterprise, Industry Pro & Enterprise.
- Setup does not have the forced product key screen.
- It has .NET Framework 4.8 pre-included.
- .NET 3.5 is pre-enabled.
- TLS 1.1/1.2 support.
- It has BypassESU Blue pre-installed.
- All SKUs were rebased so it consumes less storage space (at the expense of not being able to uninstall updates)

Cons:
- It is only updated to 2023-12 level and not higher. (Microsoft does not offer Security Only updates past 2024 and newer updates causes the OS to BSOD at startup.)
