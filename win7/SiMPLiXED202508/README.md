Pros:
- Comes will all Windows 7 SKUs (Minus the N and E variants)
- It uses the Windows 10 setup (skinned a bit to look like Windows 7's) to support ESD files. (The ISO size will be smaller overall)
- It has .NET Framework 4.8 pre-included.
- It has Visual C++ 2005-2022 pre-included.
- It comes with SmartFix Tool pre-included.
- It has Internet Explorer 11 pre-installed but you can revert back to Internet Explorer 8.
- It doesn't come with Microsoft Edge pre-installed.

Cons:
- Due to the fact that all updates are uninstallable, the installed disk size suffers from it (the installed size is 19GB)
- Windows has a 3 day trial instead of a 30 day one.
